## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS (Achieved)
* **Front-end Framework.** Using Twitter Bootstrap for Navigation and Footer styling.

## PROBLEMS FACED
* Single Page Application Bias - Throughout some of the earlier days i had kept thinking of this project as a single page app and did not put enough consideration to the routing and ways that each page will link which could have improved my workflow.
* Wireframing to development - After wireframing my idea i had not realised the how complex some of the associations and tasks i had set out to were going to be, and due to this i feel that i did not achieve my initial goals. 
* JQUERY Framework Conflicts - due to the use of Twitter Bootstrap and the additional complexity of Chartkick, the charts were not displaying correctly hence were removed.
* Lack of knowledge with user models - I feel i did not have a good enough understanding of users/sessions to be able to associate them correctly to the portfolios.

## FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS
* Implement live charts into dashboard view.
* Implement correct association for news and stocks
* Implement correct association for users and portfolios
* Implement autocomplete forms for news and stocks search
